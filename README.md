# Synthetic-Label-Generation

## Purpose
This repo contains files that are used to generate YOLOv3 formatted labels from the black-and-white ground truth images generated from the CityEngine script.

## Using this repo
The only script that should be edited and used is preprocess_syn_xview_background_gt_labels. This file takes 4 arguments that you need to worry about:
* syn_data_dir
* syn_annos_dir
* syn_box_dir
* syn_txt_dir
More detail coming soon
